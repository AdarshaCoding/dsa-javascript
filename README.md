### Arrays

1.  In JavaScript, Array can contain any type of values and it is index based (0, 1, 2, etc..), example - Number, String, Boolean, Objects, Functions etc...
2.  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, true, {name: "Adarsha", city:"Bengaluru"}, function(){console.log("Hello World!")}]
3.  Array has lots of in-built methods like sort, slice, indexOf, findIndex, map, filter, reduce, forEach...

#### Loops In JavaScript

- Different loops: for, while, do-while, for-of, for-in

#### Sorting Techniques

1.  Bubble sort : O(n2)
    - uses two loops, 1 (outer loop) for iterating over the each array elements and 1 (inner loop) for swapping the elements
